This project involves developing an image caption generator using the Flickr dataset, where VGG16 serves as the encoder and an RNN as the decoder. 
VGG16 extracts features from the images, which are then utilized by the RNN to generate descriptive captions. Implementing beam search during prediction. Trained over 50 epochs, the model achieves an accuracy of 0.65.
